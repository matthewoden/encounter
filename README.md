# Encounter
An experiment to create an encounter management system for pathfinder.

## Usage
Want to install, serve, compile sass, or elm?
Type the following into your terminal (at the root of the repo):
```
make
```

Or, if `make` doesn't work on your machine, try this:
```
npm i --no-progress && elm package install && npm run start
```
... which is just the makefile script.

## Tooling:
- webpack for building
- elm 0.16
- sass for css
- postcss for busywork and minification.
- webpack-dev-server for serving and live-reloading


## Roadmap:
Set up some kind of deployment.
